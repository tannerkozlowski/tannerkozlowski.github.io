Client - What I was hired for.
LinuxAcademy, a training platform for technicians, was in the midst of creating a more performant and maintainable reporting section.
I was added to the task force, in the hopes that I could help them deliver promptly and meet the deadline.

Contributions - What value I added to the project.
The team lacked the necessary man-power who could handle Angular 5 code-base.
Urgency-striken code-base lacked quality and I could see that it was holding back the productivity of the team a big time. It needed some serious surgery.
I worked out a refactoring plan that spanned over 2 weeks, and put it into action from day 3.
For me, it was a going an extra mile, and it definitely contributed to the timely delivery of the product.

In the first place, they hired me for the Ruby on Rails back-end. They were thrilled to have me actively taking lead in the Angular front-end as well, for it being what they needed the most help with.

Challenges - How I overcome them.
Angular Material is a great library - no doubt in that. But it isn't very customization-friendly.
I had to deal with a lot of difficulties making an Angular Material component look exactly the way the design illustrated it. Sometimes I used some elaborate hacks to deliver an esthetically and egonomically pleasing UI/UX.
For example, to render a table that had a couple of column-grouping braces over the header, I tried 6 different approaches with different drawbacks. Finally, I settled with absolutely-positioned child divs of the ths so they could share the parents width while overlapping with its peers using z-Index.

Accomplishments - What I learned from this engagement.
You have to actively communicate with the designers. This makes everyone's life easier and keeps the project from being stuck by some insignificant details.
Here's the story.
The design has a fancy border effect to a component, and I could finish the component in 8 hours except that part.
Now the fancy border is going to eat up more than 4 hours of my precious time.
Rather than trying hard to do it, I would ask the designer if it really matters. He could say YES, but learning that 4 hours will be spent on this little nuance, he agrees to reconsider it.

I have learned another lesson in prioritization of tasks in favor to the bigger picture.
Urgency-importance matrix also helped.
