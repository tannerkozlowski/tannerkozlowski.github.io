Client - What I was hired for.
AcuityScheduling, a famous scheduling SaaS for SMBs, decided to increase its market share.
As a part of that endeavor, they decided to develop a new functional branch that targeted on companies of larger scale.
I was hired to deliver that, along with the in-house team of 4. The CEO, Gavin, personally managed the project, and I was in charge of the front-end along with Brian, a veteran developer of the company.

Contributions - What value I added to the project.
The foremost thing that caught my attention was the chain link where front-end connects with its GraphQL counter-part.
The original Redux-based state management had to be adjusted for it.
I introduced Apollo, the GraphQL client, to the team, and gradually replaced the entire Redux platform with it.
At the end of the day, the Apollo-powered front-end worked better with GraphQL and eliminated the old-school Redux conventions that only added weight to the React components.


Challenges - How I overcame them.
Most of the challenges were technological.
The biggest one was the usage of HOCs and render props. (HOC - Higher Order Component)
I literally lacked experience with it, and no way close to the sopistication. There came my mentor, Brian, who guided me through it via one to-the-point example he had written.
On the other hand, I studied the best examples online and tried them on the code-base until I figured out the essence of those concepts.
It took me 7 extra hours to catch up and start writing beautiful HOC pieces.

Accomplishments - What I learned from this engagement.
Technologically, I elevated my React skill in terms of scalability and re-usability.
It also gave me a realization of why a mentorship is important. The mentorship from Brian literally saved me and the team tens of hours.

Testimonials - What my teammates thought of me.
Brian commented in the following Linkedin recommendation.
Liu is a great React developer, he listens and applies feedback readily. Months later his code is still surviving strong, and I know if I have to go add to Liu's code it will be a pleasure.
