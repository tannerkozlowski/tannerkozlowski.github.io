Client - What I was hired for.
After 4 tough stages of technical interview, MyTime decided to hire me to help them accelerate the improvement of the product. As a beginner in the MyTime echo system, I received a lot of mentorship from number of team leads and touched almost every parts of the project.

Contributions - What value I added to the project.
There is nothing fancy or legendary.
I built Merchant Data Ingestion module, fixed 2 dozens of front-end issues, and helped upgrading AngularJS 1.6 front-end to Angular 7.

Challenges - How I overcame them.
It was the longest on-boarding for me as a freelance developer. Furthermore, the learning curve was very steep.
To accelerate the on-boarding process, I studied the backlog tasks in advance and volunteered for some of the tasks that could serve as cornerstones. Coupling it with my full-blown diligency, I managed to start producing value from day 4.

On the other hand, I composed Docker images to streamline the development process. It was for my own good, as I had issues with gem installation on my local machine.

Accomplishments - What I learned from this engagement.
As a "junior" developer for almost 5 months, I knew I wasn't very happy.
I asked my honest self why.
And the answer?
I needed Responsibility.

Now, I can accurately picture my dream job.
It has little to do with the paycheck or the people. It is my role in the project that matters.
