  header: About
  content:
      left: I strive to become a <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-pragmatic-quick-reference/" target="_new">Pragmatic Programmer</a>. I put special emphasis on software architecture. TDD, SOLID principles and Design patterns are the paradigms I live by as a programmer. I seek the responsibility, whether it is leading a team or owning a feature of the project.
      right: In my free time, I enjoy planting, cooking and writing. I am also a Karate green belt. Practicing strong self-discipline is what makes my life vigorous. As a bookworm and a coffee mania, a good book and an original coffee mug are the best presents for me.
      bottom: I live in Mexico City, Mexico
