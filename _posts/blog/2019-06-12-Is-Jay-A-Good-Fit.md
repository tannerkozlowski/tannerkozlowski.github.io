I worked for 7 startups, as a full-time employee for 4 of them, and a contractor for the other 3.

During the process, I taught myself to be creative, innovative and entrepreneurial while delivering what is expected from me - the high-quality software.

Some of my significant contributions are:
- helping a gaming startup increase the __annual revenue by 8.9%__
- helping an AI startup land __2 rounds of venture funding__
- helping a drone-tech startup __sell their business__

I engage in my daily endeavors with passion and share the ambition of the team making an impact on people's lives. This makes me a self-initiator.

> People who are passionate can be trained in everything. But we don't know how to train in attitude.

I strongly believe in the above quote, and I personally experienced it while working at startups.  
I work hard, be part of the team, and am willing to take challenges as the founders do.

Fully understanding the startup life, I am ready to jump in and make things right, and very accustomed to wearing many hats whenever needed.

Things that I take seriously while working at startups are:
- sticking to and living by the company value
- getting to know the team culture and being a happy part of it
- open communication and welcoming constructive criticism

The strongest personal trait of mine is self-discipline. It breeds many of my positive work ethics.  
Everyday is my struggle to build world-class self-discipline. You can try <a href="https://30daysofdiscipline.com">30 days of discipline</a> too.

I want to see myself join you in your startup journey and make difference.  
Until then, take care.
