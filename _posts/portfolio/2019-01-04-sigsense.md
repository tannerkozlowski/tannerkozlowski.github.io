### Team

<a href="http://www.sigsensetech.com" target="_blank">Sigsense Technologies</a>, in its infancy, had to build an AI-driven device monitoring platform.  
We had the design ready, and I owned the project as the sole full-stack developer.

### Contributions

#### 2 rounds of venture funding!

- The whole REST API using NodeJS and ExpressJS
- The whole front-end using ReactJS and Redux
- 9 different types of data visualizations using D3 and Highcharts
- Machine learning UI that helps the underlying AI engine collect and analyze the patterns in device incidents
- Microservices architecture on top of Docker

### Challenges

The Machine Learning module needed some input from the users directly onto the already-rendered graphs.  
Specifically, I had to implement **on-the-fly drawing and moving of colored pillars** as a part of the graph.  
The target graph was built with Highchart library, and the official documentation wasn't for such use cases.

I did what a desperate would do. I literally dissected the library's source code and documented necessary interfaces one by one. When done, I put them together to build a highly interactive graph that helped users mark the incident time ranges over the metrics plot.

### Microservices and Containerization
<img src="/img/portfolio/microservices-sigsense.png" alt="Mircoservices Architecture" width="100%">

As the back-end of the product grew in terms of both complexity and scale, we needed to switch to a modularized approach.  
The final goal was to keep a number of standalone services that could be __built, deployed, scaled and maintained independently of other existing services__.

The application was splitted into 4 different services.
- Auth
- Machine Learning
- Device Logs
- Company and Fleet management

Above diagram shows exactly why we decided to move forward with containerization and Docker. It also, somehow, shows the evolution in IT infrastructure space.  

In the long run, Microservices architecture served the paradigms of ```Separation of Concern``` and ```Agile Development``` well. It also opened the door for the following benefits:  
- Reduced complexity (easy breakdown of team)
- Reduced risk (deployment in chunks)
- Easy maintenance (incremental upgrade of services)

### Accomplishments, My lesson

The choice of technology deeply impacts productivity. And all different choices should be given enough consideration with the longest vision involved in it.

Here's the story.  
The Machine Learning module's interactive graph could have been much easier if we started with D3 in the very first place.  
We were short-sighted in the beginning and saw that Highchart would help us build most of the visualizations effortlessly. And there came the hardest and the unexpected.  
If we had **considered more scenarios and use-cases** of the product, we could have ended up starting with D3.
_In the end, we used it on 3 complicated visualizations though._
